<h3>Overview</h3>
This app was developed as part of a software development course assignment. In this assignment, I created LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI displays:

     My latest tweets. From the command line, type 'node liri.js my-tweets' to see my last 20 tweets and when they were created.

     Song information. From the command line, type 'node liri.js spotify-this-song <your song name choice goes here>'. It will return the following information:
        Artist
        Song name
        Preview link of the song from Spotify
        The album that the song is from

    Movie information. From the command line, type 'node liri.js movie-this <your movie name choice goes here>'. It will return the following information:
        Title of movie
        Year the movie came out
        IMDB rating
        Rotten Tomatoes rating
        Country where the movie was produced
        Language of the movie
        Plot of the movie
        Actors in the movie

    Random text file. From the command line, type 'node liri.js do-what-it-says'. It will take the text inside of a text file and use its contents to call one of LIRI's commands.

Enjoy!
